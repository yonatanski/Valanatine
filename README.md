# Valentine site

A simple Valentine-themed page with Yes/No buttons and GIFs.

## Viewing the GIFs

GIFs are loaded from Giphy via iframes. **If you open `index.html` by double-clicking (file://), the GIFs may not load** because browsers often block external content on local files.

**To see the GIFs, run a local server from this folder:**

- **Node:** `npx serve .` then open http://localhost:3000  
- **Python 3:** `python -m http.server 8000` then open http://localhost:8000  

Then open the URL in your browser and the GIFs should work.
